###### HND Software Development Project | Graded Unit Module
##### A Digital Production Traveller Management System     
      
This Repository contains my project for the Graded Unit at Dundee & Angus College to work towards my        
**Higher National Diploma** to which i recieved the Overall Grade of **A - 86%**, The Project consisted of a Planning Phase, Development & Testing Phase and finally an Evaluation Phase where I documented my development processes with recommendations on where to improve on in future projects.        
Initially, this project was created for the company **MEP Technologies**, who were my client throughout the project, giving me a real-world insight into project management.     
        
###### *This repository contains an alternative version of the project's source code and full assets, with all MEP Technologies' intellectual property and confidential information removed.*     

In my spare time, I plan to continue developing this project, implementing features that i could not get developed within the timeframe and or deadline of the project, The features will be updated based on these feature updates.     
          
*The system can currently provide:*
- Provide a secure login system with protections against SQL Injection or other malicious security flaws.
- A selection of Production Travellers from which an end user can select.
- A clean and professional User Interface that is simple for all users.
- A Traveller Log system that displays content that was recently uploaded into the database.
- Search Functionality in submitted travellers page. 
- Exporting Functionality to external programs for further logistical logging and sorting.
- Support for a Sign-Up Functionality.
- Initials Slider for Auto-fill in a Traveller Template.
